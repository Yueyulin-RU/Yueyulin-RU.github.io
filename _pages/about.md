Bachelor
======
In 2014, after the university entrance exam, he went to South China Normal university to start his undergraduate student life and majored in Electronics Science and Technology at the department of Physics and Telecommunication Engineering. From 2016 to 2018, he joined the research group of Prof. Zhanghan and started his path of research. In the course of two years, he won several awards, including the second prize of the 15th National Challenge Cup, Special prize of the 14th Challenge Cup in Guangdong Province, First prize of Guangdong Electronic Design Contest and so on with his team members.

After graduation, he decided to become a post-undergraduate student in the SCNU Applied Molecular Spectroscopy and Remote Sensing Group, under the co-supervisions of Prof. Katarina Svanberg and Prof. Sune Svanberg. He served as the course assistant on the course Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy given by Sune Svanberg, and had the best result of all the students in the examination. He is the first and sole student author of one published scientific journal article on advanced imaging. In the second year, he applied for scholarship and became an exchange student at the Lund Laser Centre, LLC, in Lund, Sweden for six months. During his stay in LLC, he worked with Dr. Patrik Lundin, Dr. Emilie Krite Svanberg, Dr. Anna-Lena Sahlberg and so on. Based on the work he done in Sweden, a paper on gas in scattering media absorption spectroscopy which developing advanced diagnostics of human lungs was published in 2021. After coming back to China, he worked with his group member and had another co-first author publication on optical detection of flying disease-carrying mosquitos. After three years work in Suneâ€™s group, he had five publications and one patent based on what he has done.
